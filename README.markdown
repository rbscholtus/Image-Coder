# Image Coder
Image Coder is an easy-to-use sandbox that helps students to play around with pixel-based image manipulation using Java code, and study graphics-related concepts. The main idea of Image Coder is that you write a snippet of Java code and apply it directly to an image.

Please see the wiki page on how to run the application.
